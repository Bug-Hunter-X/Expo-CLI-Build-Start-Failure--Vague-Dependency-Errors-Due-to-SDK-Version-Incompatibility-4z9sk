# Expo CLI Build/Start Failure: Vague Dependency Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo CLI: build or start failures caused by dependency version conflicts with the Expo SDK.  The error messages from the CLI can often be unclear, making diagnosis difficult. This example focuses on resolving these vague dependency errors to guide developers towards troubleshooting.

## Problem

When working with Expo, updating the SDK version or introducing new libraries may lead to unexpected errors during the build or start process. These errors frequently arise from incompatible dependency versions.  The error messages lack specificity, making it hard to pinpoint the exact source of the problem. 

## Solution

The solution involves careful dependency management, often requiring adjusting package versions or using compatible alternatives.

1. **Check Expo SDK Compatibility:** Ensure all your dependencies are compatible with the current Expo SDK version. Consult the documentation for each library to find compatible versions.
2. **Use Expo's Compatibility Checker:** Expo provides tools and resources to help with compatibility checking.
3. **Upgrade/Downgrade Dependencies:** Experiment with upgrading or downgrading your dependencies until you find a combination that works with your SDK version.
4. **Look for Clearer Error Messages:** Examine the complete error output closely. Sometimes, the root cause is hidden within more detailed logs. 
5. **Community Support:** Engage with the Expo community; forums and issue trackers may offer insights into similar issues.

The solution requires careful analysis of the error messages and adjusting package versions.  Here's an illustrative example:

// bug.js
import MapView from 'react-native-maps'; // Assume incompatible version

// ... rest of the code ...

// bugSolution.js
// Solution: Identify and replace incompatible packages with compatible versions.
import MapView from 'react-native-maps'; // Use a compatible version.  Check npm for the latest version compatible with your expo sdk version

// OR you may use a different library compatible with expo.

// ... rest of the code ...

To resolve this, you'll need to:
1. Carefully examine the full error message and logs to pinpoint the incompatible dependency.
2. Check the npm page for the problematic package (e.g., `react-native-maps`).
3. Find a version compatible with your current Expo SDK version.
4. Update your `package.json` file to reflect the correct version.
5. Run `expo install` or `npm install` to update your project's dependencies.
6. Rebuild your app.
